# The RTC Room Panel
This is the display for our people within the chat room.
Talking people are arranged first. They will be displayed big (TODO).
Then it is ourself. Then the people streaming whom aren't muted.
Then the people streaming whom are muted.
Then finally, everyone else (the people in snapshot mode).
